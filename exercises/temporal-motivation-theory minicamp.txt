Remember: 
		expectancy x value
motivation = -----------------------
		impulsivity x delay

0. select a task you're having trouble motivating yourself for
	writing anki cards for minicamp notes
1. does the task seem likely to be completed? if not, why?
 	yes

2. does the value of the task seem high or low? if low, why?
	low, I am skeptical that the cards are actually going to teach me something, or help me build habits. Plus I feel a little silly.

3. do the rewards of the task seem near or far away? if far away, why?
	far away, I won't get the results until quite a while from now

4. are there ways you could increase expectancy or value or decrease delay?
	4.2	- ask someone to review cards and suggest improvements
	    	- ask how to build habits with anki or other software
		- "these cards are going to help me be a more effective person by allowing me to choose effective goals, have high productivity, accurate beliefs and self modify in productive ways"
	 	- notice that feeling silly is not a reliable signal, make it seem like a positive one
	4.3	- find something to reward myself with when I am done with the cards
